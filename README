# Instagram Clone Project
This is a project where I try to develop a fullstack clone of Instagram, I will be focusing on implementing the core features, so a few "non-core" features wont be fully functional. This project is an ongoing process, but progress might be slow at times due to my busy schedule. Feel free to contribute if you're interested!

## Project Overview

The goal is to replicate essential Instagram features, such as but not limited to:

- Account creation and authentication
- Posting photos and videos
- Editing user profiles
- Liking and commenting on posts
- Following and followers system

## Current Status
Account creation and post creation functionalities are semi-functional. Iam currently actively working on these features and implementing additional functionalities. A few pages (profile page, messages page, reels page etc) need to be developed.

## Future Development
Future plans include:
- Finish account management
- Improve post creation and interaction features
- Add more intuitive elements

## Run locally
To run locally: 
- You will need python (I personally use python 3.11, but other versions might be ok). - Install the python modules in the requirements.txt file. 
- Then run the main.py file.
